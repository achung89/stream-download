Test 1: tried fetching 7 gb of data with fetch and stream writing to indexedDB, crashed after 3gb
  possible causes:
    1. need to create a writeable stream in order to clear read stream buffer
    2. db write promises are backfilling promise queue
    3. gc not happening as often as we think
    4. chunks are being held in memory somewhere unrelated to 1)
    5. requests are coming faster than we can read them
